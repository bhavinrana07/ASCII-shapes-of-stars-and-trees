# ASCII-shapes-of-stars-and-trees
As a geeky Christmas fan I want to generate ASCII shapes of stars and trees in three different sizes so that I can decorate my office nicely for Christmas.

![Sample output](sample_output.png)

The following sizes will be available:
 - S (small): 5 lines height
 - M (medium): 7 lines height
 - L (large): 11 lines height
